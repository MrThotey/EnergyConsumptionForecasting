# Analysis of Electric Power Consumption Patterns

This repository contains the data, code, and results for the thesis titled "Analysis of Patterns and Trends in Electric Power Consumption Data Using Machine Learning Algorithms." This work is completed by Sundeep Sundar Thotey as part of the requirements for the Master of Science degree at Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU).

## Repository Contents
- `Data/`: Folder containing the original dataset used in the analysis.
- `Code/`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used for the machine learning models.
- `Results/`: PDF of the executed Jupyter Notebook showcasing the analysis and results.

## Study Overview
The thesis conducts a detailed analysis using machine learning models such as SARIMA, NBEATS, and LSTM to explore electricity consumption patterns. These models help understand seasonal variations, long-term dependencies, and forecast accuracy in electric power usage, aiming to optimize energy distribution networks.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the `Code/` directory to view the Jupyter Notebook.
3. The dataset used for the analysis is located in the `Data/` directory.
4. Results and visualizations can be found in the PDF within the `Results/` directory.

## Data
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and consists of multi-year records of electric power consumption. Due to data sharing policies, please refer to the dataset directly from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set.

## System Requirements
- A PC with at least 16GB of RAM and an Intel i7 processor or better.

## Installation
To run the notebooks, you will need Python and several libraries related to data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pmdarima darts tensorflow keras scikit-learn
```
